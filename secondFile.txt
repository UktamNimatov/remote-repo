One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities Similarities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud ABABA
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you, lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
