I'm the boy in your other phone XAXAXA
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone XAXAXA
We talk and then you walk away every day
Oh you don't think twice bout me AXAXAX
And maybe you're right to doubt me but
But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light AXAXA
Yeah if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
